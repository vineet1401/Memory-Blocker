The game consists of four colored buttons (usually red, green, blue, and yellow). The objective is to repeat a sequence of light and sound patterns that the device generates, which progressively becomes more challenging as the game goes on.  
Here are the basic rules of Simon:  
1. The game begins with the device lighting up a single color and producing a corresponding sound.  
2. The player must then replicate the pattern by pressing the colored button that corresponds to the illuminated one.  
3. If the player succeeds, the device adds another color to the sequence, making it longer and more complex.  
4. The player must continue to mimic the growing pattern accurately.  
5. If the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.  
6. The player's objective is to achieve the highest score possible by remembering and correctly replicating increasingly longer and more complex patterns.
